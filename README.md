code and data files from project studying juniperus ashei reproduction and pollen production

the sub-folders are as follows:
1. raw-data: this contains excel/csv files for data pertaining to reproductive output for focal trees from all study sites
2. scripts: this contains all R scripts used to process data and perform statistical analyses
3. processed-data: this contains excel/csv files that have been manipulated in R. It also contains processed images used for analyses 
4. figures: this contains figures processed from R scripts
5. results: this contains maps or results from statistical analyses processed from R scripts

**note: my project uses a lot of high-resolution drone images. Due to data size limitation, these are not stored on GitHub. I will make my drone images and drone image output files (mostly orthomosaiced images) available in a Zenodo repository
